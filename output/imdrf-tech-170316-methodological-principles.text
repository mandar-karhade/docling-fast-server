## Preface

The document herein was produced by the International Medical Device Regulators Forum (IMDRF),  a  voluntary  group  of  medical  device  regulators  from  around  the  world.  The document has been subject to consultation throughout its development.

There are no restrictions on the reproduction, distribution or use of this document; however, incorporation  of  this  document,  in  part  or  in  whole,  into  any  other  document,  or  its translation into languages other than English, does not convey or represent an endorsement of any kind by the International Medical Device Regulators Forum.

## 1.0 Introduction

The  International  Medical  Device  Regulators  Forum  (IMDRF)  Registry  Working  Group was created with the purpose of developing:

- (1) Essential  principles  for  linking  electronic  patient,  device  and  outcome  registries and/or  related  data  repositories  or  identifiers  such  as  Unique  Device  Identifiers (UDIs), including the principles behind data access, security, informatics formats, governance  and  other  key  areas  related  to  global  regulatory  applications  for medical device evaluation; and
- (2) Essential principles related to optimal methodologies for analysis of heterogeneous  data  sources  applied  to  medical  device  safety  signal  detection, performance and reliability.

This document focuses on the task described in (2). In doing so, the document leverages the essential principles behind data access, security, informatics formats and other key areas related to global applications for medical device information described in (1). It applies the medical device registry definition from (1) and introduces the methodological concept of international Coordinated Registry Networks (iCRNs) to maximize the potential of data captured in the international registries.

This methodological document also builds on the IMDRF Common Data Elements (CDE) for Medical Device Identification document. The CDE effort outlines the common data elements for medical device identification that may be used through regulatory activities or process (pre-market, and post-market), including the future possibility of electronic regulatory submission of device identification information and covers the harmonization of terms and their definitions (IMDRF CDE).

Much  of  the  material  presented  and  developed  here  was  preceded  by  multi-stakeholder work advanced by the U.S. National Medical Device Registry Task Force. In particular, the methods discussed there should apply reasonably directly to the international setting. This document highlights aspect of those considerations that differ in important ways from the national setting (Medical Device Registry Task Force).

## 2.0 Scope

This document provides information and guidance on:

- International  coordination  in  methodologies  that  would  add  value  to  multiple international stakeholders including regulators;
- Methodological  principles  in  the  clinical  evaluation  of  performance/effectiveness and  safety  across  the  device  lifecycle  using  international  Coordinated  Registry Networks (iCRNs);
- Methodological principles in signal detection via iCRNs.

The  focus  will  primarily  be  on  implantable  therapeutic  devices,  as  this  area  represents highest risk devices with most registry activities and opportunity to reach consensus.

## 4.0 Definitions

Clinical evaluation: The assessment and analysis of clinical data pertaining to a medical device to verify the clinical safety and performance of the device when used as intended by the manufacturer (GHTF/SG5/N1:2007).

Lifecycle :  All  phases  in  the  life  of  a  medical  device,  from  the  initial  conception  to  final decommissioning and disposal (ISO 14971:2007).

Medical Device Registry : Organized system with a primary aim to increase the knowledge on  medical  devices  contributing  to  improve  the  quality  of  patient  care  that  continuously collects  relevant  data,  evaluates  meaningful  outcomes  and  comprehensively  covers  the population defined by exposure to particular device(s) at a reasonably generalizable scale (e.g.  international,  national,  regional,  and  health  system)".  We  think  that  such  revised definition might better reflect the use of medical devices registry data to increase the quality of medical care.

Signal  detection :  The  process  of  determining  patterns  of  association  or  unexpected occurrences that have the potential to impact patient management decisions and/or alter the known benefit-risk profile of a device.

## 5.0 Vision

- I. We envision international harmonization of medical device registries analytical  methodologies  via  international  Coordinated  Registry  Networks (iCRNs) based on demonstrated best practices;
- II. While  not all countries will contribute registry data to every device evaluation, all countries will benefit from the global collaborative;
- III. The  collaboration  should  be  based  on  a  systematic  agreed  upon  process  for sharing and evaluating data/findings  from medical device registries amongst;
- IV. All registries will agree on pre-specified analyses and collaborative sharing of the outputs with each other and  the regulators;
- V. A  standing  IMDRF  registry  working  group  should  exist  to  facilitate  this process.

## 6.0 Factors Contributing to Between-Country Variation in use and Outcomes Associated with use of Medical Devices

Several key characteristics contribute to differences among countries in both the use of medical devices as well as their associated outcomes. These include but are not limited to:

MARKET  ENVIRONMENT:    Because  not  all  medical  devices  are  available  in  all countries at the same time, the length of market experience will vary across countries. Moreover,  medical  device  adoption  will  differ  as  a  function  of  the  extent  of  device reimbursement, the potential population size exposed to the device, and the number of medical device competitors currently in the market.

INTRINSIC  AND  EXTRINSIC  ETHNIC  FACTORS:  Specific  characteristics  of  the populations  differ  across  countries,  even  for  the  same  indication.  Intrinsic  factors include  genetic  information,  body  mass  index,  body  composition,  and  other  ethnic features;  extrinsic  factors  involve  aspects  shaped  by  the  cultural  and  behavior  climate such  as  medical  practice  patterns,  diet,  and  other  environmental  conditions.    For example, the OECD reports that life expectancy at birth ranges from 56.8 years in South Africa  to  83.4  years  in  Japan;  infant  mortality  rates  from  1.8  per  1000  live  births  in Finland to 40.9 in India (OECD, 2013) and in 2011, total fat in grams/capita/day from 87.3 in Japan to 171.5 in Austria. Additionally, extrinsic factors could influence some device  performance  outcomes  more  than  others,  such  as  patient  reported  outcomes (Wild et al., 2009).

REGISTRY  CHARACTERISTICS:    Key  features  that  may  vary  across  countries include  granularity of data,  degree of coverage or completeness of the market (e.g. full census, partial census, sample), duration of longitudinal follow-up, attrition rates, data privacy standards, regulation, ability and level of information exchange, and adherence to external standards (OECD, 2016).  In addition there are well documented variations in consistency of data element terms and definitions, variation in data quality and the degree of use of standard data validated against master data sources. Recent example of MDEpiNet  PASSION/RAPID  project  is  a  good  illustration of how  informatics principles  were  used  to  develop  Common  Data  Elements  (CDE)s  which  created  an opportunity and link the CDEs to IMDRF CDEs, and integration of Device Identifier of UDI and standard GUDID data into the registries (Morales, 2016).

MEDICAL DEVICE REGULATION REQUIREMENTS: Requirements for assessment of clinical data in general show significant differences among major regions on a global level.  For  methodological  principles  applied  to  registry  data  these  differences  do  not have  a  major  impact  as  they  can  easily  be  implemented  in  the  various  processes  by global regulatory bodies.

As an example, the demonstration of equivalence between  medical devices  in Europe will  be  subject  to  change  as  a  result  of  legislative  revision.  This  will  provide  greater detail  with  regards  to  the  access  to  data  and  the  clinical,  technical  and  biological requirements needed to establish equivalence. This is likely to impact on feasibility and economic considerations in establishing registries to collect post-market data as a part of the overall conformity assessment.

'Grandfathering' as is applied in some regions is becoming less justifiable as a result of advances  in  technology  and  standards  of  care.  As  a  consequence the  vast  majority  of

devices will be required to produce clinical evidence on their own product.  Registries can be an important source for these clinical data, if they are  of 'regulatory grade'  i.e. they  meet  the  requirements  concerning  data  quality  or  governance  and  manufacturers take  this  into  consideration  when  developing    clinical  trials  designs  and  marketing strategies.

HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEMS: Differences in health care delivery systems could also be a contributor to between country variability. For example, when patients move from one health care system to another, the capture of their long-term data can be impacted.  In addition, the differences in payment reimbursements within various health care  systems  can  impact  the  availability  of  devises  and  the  treatment  options  for  the patients.

## 7.0 Clinical Evaluation of Performance/Effectiveness and Safety using International Registry Data

## Context and Methodological Considerations 7.1

Exploiting international registries will enhance the availability of evidence related to the total product lifecycle of a medical device (Figure 1). This document focuses on analytical considerations arising from leveraging information collected from around the world (Stage 3, Figure).  We  do  not describe  general  approaches  associated  with confounding  when  clinical  data  arise  from observational  studies  or  other  routine  design features.    We  emphasize  analytical  issues related  to  the  variation  arising  due  to  the inclusion of multi-national data.

## HETEROGENEITY.VERSUS

HOMOGENEITY: The analysis of data obtained from country-specific registries involves  combining  heterogeneous  medical device information with the goal of extracting performance  and  safety  parameters.    Even when data definitions and collection strategies

Figure 1. Stages 0f Clinical Data

flow chart

are  completely  harmonized  across  registries,  differences  in  device  outcomes  will  likely persist due to both systematic and random between-country variation.  Systematic factors include  intrinsic  and  extrinsic features  of  region-specific  populations.  To  the  extent possible,  higher  priority  should  be  given  to  biological  response-related  performance  and safety  outcomes  rather  than  to  outcomes  more  prone  to  social,  life  style,  care  delivery differences.    However,  even  accounting  for  patient  clinical  features,  and  intrinsic  and extrinsic factors, random, unexplained between-country differences will remain.

POOLABILITY:  The  extent  to  which  registry-specific  information  is  combinable  or 'poolable'  will  lie  between  two  extremes:  (a)  no  pooling  and  (b)  (unadjusted)  complete pooling without accounting for country-specific features.  The no  pooling option assumes that  nothing  can  be  learned  about  a  medical  device  using  data  collected  from  another country  about  that  device.    The complete pooling option  assumes  that  patient-level information from all countries provide information about exactly the same  device effectiveness  parameters,  essentially  treating  all  data  as  if  arising  from  a  single  country. Both extremes (in their pure form) are unlikely; however, there are some situations in which pooling may be closer to one of these extremes or the other.   There could be interactions unique  to  one  or  two  countries  that  would  prohibit  pooling.   In  the  case  where  there  are limited  registries  for  the  given  condition/device  then  the  extremes  would  apply.     Non pooling of the data but looking at each countries registry data alone as a stratified analysis may be useful as well.

EXCHANGEABILITY:  Assuming  information  arising  from  international  registries  is poolable, the type of statistical dependence among the observations within and between the registries  must  be  determined  based  on  assumptions.    Exchangeability  is  the  degree  to

which observable medical device outcomes are similar, and consequently,  describes  the  dependence  in  a  probability distribution  of  all  the  outcomes.    Assuming  independence within registry conditional on a country-specific effect is a reasonable  initial  assumption  for  combining  international registries  data.  This  implies,  for  example,  assuming  that revision  rates  following  implant  with  a  particular  total  hip device, adjusting for patient-specific confounders within the i th country,  has  a  country-specific  mean  rate  Âµi,  implying that the rates could differ across countries after adjusting for patient  differences.    To  acknowledge  this  variation,  it  is assumed that the country-specific rates arise from a distribution with a common mean and variance.  Thus, the country-specific  rates  are  completely  exchangeable  across countries.  The  relative  magnitude  of  the  between-country variance in the outcomes  to  the  total variation in the outcomes  quantifies  the  degree  to  which  estimates  in  one country 'borrow' information from the ensemble of countries.  As  a  framework  in  which  to  perform  these calculations, we could extrapolate data based on similarities (or  differences)  between  country  specific  factors.  Such  an approach would be facilitated if we had access to a metric for  assessing  how  similar  the  data  was  across  countries  in question.

Nesting Trials in Registries

## SAFE PCI

The Study of Access site for Enhancement of PCI for Women (SAFE-PCI) prospectively compared radial access and femoral access in 1787 women undergoing PCI.  It was the first registry-based randomized trial conducted in the U.S. The authors indicated that '..this registry-trial infrastructure provided several efficiencies in site selection, data collection, and site workload (Sunil et al, 2014).'

MINIMUM  NECESSARY  DATA  FOR  ANALYSIS:  Every  effort  should  be  given  to adherence  to  minimum  necessary  standards  for  personal  information  in  order  to  mitigate risk.  This principle should be translated to the agreements on necessary analysis, and the data  needed  for  those  calculations.    For  example,  learning  curve-associated  revision  rate may just need time-to-event and sequence of procedures, but a similar analysis  based on real-time  events  (recall,  introduction  of  new  devices,  new  publications,  etc.)  would  need exact  dates.  Therefore,  in  the  harmonization  of  endpoint  analyses/definitions,  risks  to exposure of private information must be mitigated, even more than the general prohibitions against transfer of private information over national borders.

## Methodological Opportunities 7.2

The  methodological  features  of  international  medical  device  registries  provide  numerous opportunities to learn continuously about device performance through the product's entire life-cycle.  These opportunities are afforded by the degree of similarity or exchangeability in  the  data.    Essential  performance  evaluations  include  assessments  of  long-term  medical device  outcomes,  comparative  effectiveness  estimates  generally,  and  for  performance evaluations involving rare outcomes in particular.  Specific examples follow.

CHARACTERIZING LEARNING CURVES:  Temporal variation in market entry dates of medical devices and geographic variation in characteristics of medical device users across

countries will reduce uncertainty in time to 'steady state.' This benefit is afforded by the availability of multiple opportunities to observe 'first' use of new medical devices across different countries in relation  to  a  subsequent  broader  set  of  medical professional  users.  Understanding  learning  effects could potentially influence future training requirements worldwide.

WIDENING  INDICATIONS:  Variability  in  both the intrinsic and extrinsic ethnic features associated with  international  registry  data  will  undoubtedly include  information  about  device  performance  in different  indications.  Such  populations  will  arise due to geographic variation in market entry date of devices as well as to local practice patterns.  While any  one  registry  may  lack  sufficient  numbers  of patients to characterize medical device performance  adequately,  pooling  country-specific registry information can increase the effective sample size for such populations, thereby reducing the uncertainty of device outcomes in new populations.  Clinical data from countries with onlabel populations can be leveraged to inform other countries. However, approvals in different countries  may  have  different  indications  for  use (e.g. different intended use populations (e.g., disease, race, sex/gender) as well as different intended uses (treatment, adjunct, relief of symptoms) in the approved labeling. These factors can also complicate the pooling.

## DETERMINATION.OF.OBJECTIVE.PERFORM ANCE CRITERIA &amp; PERFORMANCE GOALS:

Like  widening  indications,  variability  in  intrinsic and  extrinsic  factors  will  enhance  the  creation  of objective performance criterion (OPC) for medical device.  By having more variety in patients one is more likely to capture the true underlying variance

## JOINT ACTION PARENT

in  the  effect  measure,  leading to greater accuracy of the effect measure. In addition using samples  from  multiple  countries  allows  for  a  greater  pooled  sample  size  and  types  of patients  to  be  included  in  the  analysis.    O'Malley  and  colleagues  demonstrated  the construction of OPCs for bare metal coronary stents in different patient types (O'Malley et al., 2003).

signal detection network in were: incident. Basic information on potentially relevant data sources should be available information on pathologies outcome parameter).  More

IDENTIFICATION  OF  SUBGROUP  EFFECTS:  In  pre-specified subgroups, it is reasonable  to  assume  that  information  about  medical  device  performance  in  a  particular subgroup  of  interest  is  related  (but  not  identical  to)  information  about  medical  device performance  in  other  subgroups.    For  example,  the  comparative  restenosis  rate  for  a particular  drug  eluting  stent  relative  to  another  stent  may  differ  among  diabetic  patients with  ST-elevated  MI,  diabetic  patients  with  a  non-ST  elevated  MI,  non-diabetic  patients with  ST-elevated  MI,  and  non-diabetic  patients  with  non-ST-elevated  MI  but  these  rates should be related in some way. If a particular country has small numbers of patients within particular subgroups, borrowing information from similar subgroups from other countries will  increase  the  precision  associated  with each particular country's subgroup estimate. In  addition  to  examination  of  pre-specified factors, the availability of international registries will support hypothesis generating subgroup  effects  through  the  use  of  newer big data methods (Wang et al., 2015).

## IDEAL (D) Recommendations related to registries

NESTING RANDOMIZED  TRIALS  IN REGISTRIES: In addition to analytical strategies associated with international registry data, access to such registries facilitates faster accrual of subjects to participate in clinical trials, thereby shortening  the  duration  of  the  trial.    The infrastructure available within a registry may also be used to identify subjects to participate in comparator arms in experimental studies.  Efficiency gains could be  realized  through  statistical  matching  or other  design  strategies  by  analyzing  data found in registries prior to randomization (see SAFE PCI).

## COMPARATIVE.EFFECTIVNESS

APPLICATION:  International Consortium of Orthopedic Registries (ICOR) is an example  of  using  distributed health data system with harmonized data definitions and data  extraction  followed  by  combing  the data  using  innovative  methodology  across multiple  national  orthopedic  registries.  The coordinating center communicates with registries that apply standardized SAS syntax  to  their  data  and  send  summaries from  each  registry  to  coordinating  center. This structure of the system as a

decentralized  distributed  network  helps  overcome  issues  related  to  security,  operations,

legal,  and  those  related  to  patient  privacy.  It  has  major  advantage  of  strengthening estimation  by  borrowing  information  from  multiple  registries.  The  analytic  method  of ICOR  to  combining  survival  curves  is  a  flexible  and  robust  approach  to  comparative effectiveness as it allows evaluation of risk change over time, determination of interactions and the risk factors (see IMDRF Registry Essential Principle).

RECENT  TOTAL  PRODUCT  LIFECYCLE  (TPLC)  APPROACHES  WITH  STRONG EMPHASIS  ON  REGISTRIES.  One  of  the  approaches  to  TPLC  is  the  IDEAL-D framework (Sedrakyan et al., 2016). The IDEAL(D) framework builds on prior efforts by an  international  expert  consensus  group  that  initially  described  the  studies  and  reporting requirements  for  developing  evidence  for  new  surgical  procedures:  starting  form  first  in man  through  widespread  adoption.  There  are  4-5  stages  within  this  Framework  (IDEAL stands for Idea, Development, Exploration, Assessment, Long-term study). The Idea stage focuses  on  the  'first-in-man'  use  of  new  technology.  In  the  next  Development  stage, inventors  modify  the  technology  and  in  the  Exploration  stage  other  users  get  involved addressing technical details, indications, operator learning curves and quality control. In the Assessment stage operators collaborate on a definitive study of the new technique. Finally, Long term study (Stage 4) is needed to detect late and rare side effects, 'indication creep' and  performance  variation.  The  application  of  this  realistic  framework  for  devoices  as IDEAL(D) has a strong emphasis on registries (see the box).

## 8.0 Signal Detection

## Context and Methodological Considerations 8.1

Single and aggregate reports and 'root cause analyses' are useful for identifying unexpected major  harms.    For  example,  the  ASR  artificial  hip  failure  was  recognized  by  MHRA  in collaboration  with  clinicians  based  on  case  series  reports  with  unique  failure  features (Medical  Device  Alert).  However,  only  systematic  processes  will  ensure  continuous evaluation  of  implants  to  determine  comparative  performance  and  differences  between them.  Many  important  considerations,  such  as  comparisons  of  rates  of  events  between distinct sets of devices, are best addressed on the basis of summary measures rather than by informal aggregation of individual anecdotes.  By shifting the focus from individual reports towards  systematic  summary  analyses,  we  can  exploit  the  power  of  registries  to  detect strong signals.  For example, the Australian National Joint Registry found higher rates of implant revision for the entire class of  metal on metal implants particularly those that are larger than 36mm (Australian  National Joint Registry).

Registry fitness for use in the regulatory setting would depend on the type of the registry. For example, some registries are case-based and could not provide the rates in the absence of complementary data). However, most registries that would fit the IMDRF definition of medical  device  registry  are  very  good  data  source  to  provide  rates  of  events  (IMDRF Registry Essential Principle). Registries can also help overcome regulatory limits related to sample size requirements for legacy post approval studies by allowing infrastructure that is already  embedded  in  the  health  care  delivery  system  to  serve  as  a  venue  for  addressing important  regulatory  questions,  thus  obviating  the  need  for  stand  alone,  large  postmarket cohort and offering an opportunity for effective, less costly nesting of premarket data collection.

DELAY IN SIGNAL VERIFICATION: There is potential  delay before information  from  international registries will be summarized, vetted and discussed with the regulator. Still, from the efficient regulation perspective the summary information provided by registries provide more complete picture than  anecdotal and potentially biased information available immediately from single reports or passive surveillance systems.

DEVICE and COMPONENTS ISSUES: In the instance of implants with multiple components that can be used to create 'custom' implants, the international registries will be  able  to  determine  the  'mix  and  match'  process  and allow for investigations of how components impact both effectiveness and safety.

There are limitations to a registry approach that need to be  recognized.  For  example,  in  the  field  of  orthopedics, the device removal or replacement might not happen due to advanced age, comorbidities, patient refusal, or financial  burden  on  patients.  In  addition  much  more extensive  surgery  might  occur  due  to  unavailability  of certain  components  due  to  recall  but  this  information may not be captured in the registry.

## Signal Detection

## J-MACS

Japanese Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (JMACS) is a prospective registry harmonized with the United States registry (INTERMACS), now evolving into the network of international registries (IMACS). One of the examples of its signal detection is 'transition to back-up mode', pointed out by the J-MACS event adjudication committee. The manufacturer has immediately taken actions with the regulatory agency (PMDA), to find out the root cause (open circuit of the driveline) and fixed it.

In addition the lack of use of a standard device identifier (the DI of the UDI) that can be validated against a vetted data source (in the US it would be GUDID) and the lack of a standard codeset to identify devices  impacts  the  analysis  of  device  outcome  information  both  within  and  across countries

## Methodological Opportunities 8.2

HARMONIZATION OF TERMINOLOGY: For a purpose of  IMDRF  convergence  it  is important to employ a consistent  methodological vocabulary and set of processes  for the implementation of signal detection. For example, 'outlier performance' is a term often used by  international  registries  to  describe  a  signal  detection  process  that  many  regulators consider.  From a process harmonization perspective the signal detection process can prespecify  actions that regulators will take for known issues or concerns.  We recognize that harmonization of terms and processes is evolving over time, and we may need to consider updating data analysis, data collection and leverage linkages to other data sources.

PERIODIC  UPDATES  OF  DATA  CAPTURE:  Registries  should  be  flexible  enough  to allow  for    periodic  update  of  data  capture    driven  by  the  gaps  in  evidence.    For  one example,  in  the  instance  of  hip  replacement,  over  time  new  events  such  as  soft  tissue reaction and peri-prosthetic  fractures were initially  identified outside of the context of the registry.    Based  on  those  findings,  the  additional  data  field  was  added  to  the  UK  NJR

registry  to  learn  more  about  soft  tissue  reaction.  In  addition,  the  linkage  to  other  data sources allows better examination of the peri-prosthetic fractures (sometimes captured in a separate registry. These patient outcome terms and associated device problem terms should be  codified  and  included  as  common  data  elements  in  recognized  standard  vocabularies available  for  use  across  National  and  International  health  IT  systems,  including  patient records and registries (Registry Essential Principles).

For  another  example,  after  randomized  controlled  trials  and  evidence  evaluation  from registries, the Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) procedure received widespread  adoption  with  several  hundreds  of  thousands  of  inoperable  and  high  risk patients treated with the procedure worldwide. Several years post introduction, international  registries  began  identifying  an  increased  incidence  of  valve  hemodynamic deterioration (VHD) and decreased valve leaflet mobility in a subset of  patients receiving valves possibly associated with both TAVR and SAVR. The  initial risk  factors identified included lack of coagulation therapy, larger BMI, and smaller size valve (Del Trigo et al, 2016).  These international registry findings helped direct further research to better identify the risk factors associated with use of these devices.

Note that while we  may  need to add fields to registries periodically to address emerging questions,  we  should  also  consider  when  such  updates  can  provide  for  removal  of  data fields  for  questions  that  have  been  adequately  addressed.  These  data  elements  should  be part  of  core  recognized  data  standards  and  data  code  sets.  Such  an  addition  will  make  it easier to maintain a sustainable system.

POSITIVE SIGNALS: When viewing signal detection as a method to highlight positive as well  as  negative  findings,  and  for  use  with  efficacy  and  safety  measures,  it  clarifies  the possibility  for  the  use  of  signal  detection  to  contribute to  benefit/risk  assessments.    Such assessments would fit naturally into a signal detection framework, especially with respect to determining  benefits  that  became  more  apparent  as  additional  data  were  made  available over  time  from  a  variety  of  sources,  such  as  that  assembled  from  multiple  national registries. It is straightforward to see how the process of exclusion (discussed later in terms of signal detection taxonomy) could be used to rule out specific levels of harms of interest. However, one could also leverage the same machinery to rule out lower values of efficacy (so that performance was demonstrated to be higher than a particular threshold or value). Such  findings  could  potentially  be  used  to  update  changes  in  labeling  for  a  device  that reflected the refinement in knowledge of performance of the device.

NEW  VS  MATURE  DEVICES:  There  may  be  distinct  considerations  at  play  when examining  a  registry  of  an  early  innovation  device  versus  one  of  established  devices  (as might become available with the proliferation of a given technology). Concerns for signal detection  may readily differ  depending on the relevant  maturity of devices  in the  market place.  For example, we might be more concerned with short term quantification of harms for first in kind devices, but be more concerned with potential time shifting effects (such as unanticipated results stemming from minor iterative changes) for well-established devices. With  a  larger  class  of  related  devices,  we  have  the  opportunity  to  look  for  differential performance, but this is not even possible for first in kind devices.

CAMOUFLAGING : This  effect  is  an  important  consideration  when  evaluating  devices. Considering class/attribute level versus the individual product level evaluation is a matter of debate. In general, evaluating a device on the individual level is complicated due to sample size  limitations  and  might  not  be  aligned  with  the  philosophy  of  product  development. Minor  variations  in  implant  design  are  often  performed  for  marketing  purposes  to  offer 'diverse'  products  while  from  performance  perspective  they  are  all  comparable.  Hence, class/attribute level  assessments are the first step in  signal detection process. However, in some instances the incremental changes that are considered 'benign' might lead to a much higher rate of  device  failure  for the  specific  iteration  of  the  device.  Missing  these  effects within attribute level comparison is the essence of the camouflaging problem.

This effect illustrates the importance of performing signal detection (outlier) analysis at the level of device identifier model/size cluster level in addition to implant attribute (classification)  level.    This  process  also  helps  to  revise  attributes  and  come  up  with  new ones based on real life experiences.

PROVIDER EFFECT:  Provider effect is another key consideration and needs to be taken into account to make sure effects (camouflaging, class) are not limited to a few generally underperforming  surgeons  (e.g.  volume).    The  registries,  regulators  and  professional societies  should  set  some  criteria  to  parse  out  when  it  is  a  provider  vs  device  effect. Specifically  if  there  are  known  extrinsic  or  intrinsic  factors  that  impact  the  success  of procedures/devices, this may need to be some weighted or adjusted threshold.

PRESPECIFICATION  OF  THRESHOLD  VALUES:  It  is  key  that  pre-specification  of threshold  values  for  various  signal  detection  methods  is  provided,  in  particular  when planning for sharing of information from analyses conducted in parallel on registries from different  countries.    This  will  enable  meaningful  and  timely  sharing  of  potential  signals across data sources. Pre-specifying the risk level for signal detection based on negotiation or  accumulated  strong  evidence  (e.g.  OR,  RR,  HR  2.0)  helps  to  achieve  harmonization. There might be different requirements set for early entrants versus established products in the market, component versus entire device replacement. The disparate methods themselves may also be better served by employing different types of thresholds.  For processes that are relatively  stable  and  are  based  on  all  available  information  up  to  a  certain  time  point  we may  be  less  tolerant  of  sharp  variation  than  we  would  be  for  other  processes  that  only considered the much smaller set of data available within a moving window of time (such as the most recent two months).  Finally, there might be different threshold levels for different applications. Note that agreement of a common threshold value in a particular area here is advocated explicitly to provide a sharing of comparable information; it is not intended that such  a  shared  threshold  value  must  be  adopted  uniformly  by  all  participating  regulatory authorities for their own regulatory actions.

An  additional  point  about  threshold  values  is  that  they  very  often  are  considered  in  the context of a frequentist testing scenario where one might be concerned with the probability of controlling the error rate across an entire experiment (such as type I error).  This familiar framework  can  breakdown  in  cases  of  long-term  surveillance,  in  that  the  'experiment' across which one is attempting to control error rates is poorly defined.  In these scenarios, there are strong arguments for considering a shift to a Bayesian paradigm where one instead

might focus on a continually updated posterior probability (of benefit or harm, say), rather than on the p-value from a multiply-repeated testing procedure.

## 8.2. Examples of Tools that are used in Registries

## 8.2.1 Cumulative Sum of Outcomes (CUSUM) Methodology

Cumulative sum of outcomes (CUSUM) methodology allows determination  of  excessive  rates  of failures or adverse events of implants.  CUSUM  is  a  sequential statistical analysis methodology with  graphic  application.  It  allows on  line  identification  of  changing device failure or surgical complications. There are various methods in use today. For example, a  likelihood-based  scoring  method of calculation of CUSUM is use d by the Scottish \Orthopedic registry described  as  part  of  ICOR  series

Figure 2 _ CUSUM chart for a high-rolume surgeon with a complex practice, showing an increase in outliers corresponding with the introduction of a new implant (Macpherson et aL,2011).

bar chart

(Sedrakyan et al., 2015). If the device failure rate is close to or below average, the CUSUM will remain close to zero. Outlier device or surgeon status is identified at the point set in advance and is named the prediction limit. Setting the statistical thresholds at agreed upon levels  helps  to  balance  the  risk  of  failure  against  that of  false  alerts.  Setting  a  prediction limit  is  not  an  exact  science,  and  changing  the  statistical  criteria  will  change  outlier identification. It is a classic example of the tradeoff  between sensitivity (finding potential issues) and specificity (avoiding spurious findings).  Hence the results should be interpreted as a signal that does not yet mean a bad implant or a bad device. One of the advantages of CUSUM method is ability to track  both  surgeons  and  introduction  of  the  new  device  to evaluate the surgeon-device 'package'. For example CUSUM allows tracking of outcomes of  high  volume  surgeon  with  changes  in  practice  over time  and  determination  periods  of outlier  performance  that  was  in  fact  linked  with  introduction  of  new  implants  (see  figure from Scottish Arthroplasty Registry- part of ICOR series) (Macpherson et al., 2011).

## 8.2.2 Cumulative Revision Rate over Time

Depicting an unadjusted cumulative revision rate over time after implantation  of  the  device  is  a  simple but powerful technique allowing identification  of  outlier  implants  when compared  to  overall  or  group  average. The  method  also  allows  calculation  of accompanying 95% pointwise confidence intervals using various methods.  For  example,  the  Australian orthopedic  registry process identified the ASR hip as outlier device using this method  followed  by  Cox  proportionalhazard modeling to calculate the hazard ratios  and  adjust  for  age  and  sex  in order to conduct a comparative analysis of revision rate between groups (de Steiger et al., 2011).

## 8.2.3 Funnel Plots

line chart

Another  graphical  approach  (Figure 4.) is that of funnel plots , which are based  on  application  of  Shewhart Charts in medicine (Shewhart, 2012).They are example of Statistical Process Control (SPC) methodology with valuable graphical  display  to  showcase  the distribution of the data. Through the use  of  funnel  plots,  it  is  possible  to compare  the  observed  events  (e.g. specific  device  failure)  against  the national average within the population (Spiegelhalter, 2005). In the hypothetical Figure 4 from the

registry each circle represents one device and the x-axis denotes the number  of  device  implants  combined  with  number  of  years  followed  up  for  a  particular device  (or  volume)  tracked  by  registry  for  that  device.    The  y-axis  represents  the  'true' event-rate  (unobserved).  Devices  falling  above  95%  or  99.8%  control  limits  (set  in advance)  for  risk  are  deemed  as  outliers.  For  various  'true'  event  rates  around  the  gold-

The Data Extraction and Longitudinal Trend Analysis (DELTA) approach is a variation of CUSUM  approach  also  offering  real-time medical device safety surveillance. For example,    DELTA  methodology  has  been successfully applied retrospectively and demonstrated the feasibility of an early warning  detection  system  for  faulty  Fidelis ICD leads.   The DELTA network was utilized in  a  prospective  propensity-matched  cohort analysis of 7 newly-introduced cardiovascular  devices,  using  clinical  data captured  in  the  Massachusetts  PCI  database from  2003  to  2007.  For  this  project,  the NCDR CathPCI registry was used as the data collection tool. The DELTA system identified issues in 3 out of 21 safety analyses  that  triggered  sustained  alerts  in  2 implantable devices. Patients receiving a Taxus Express2 drug-eluting stent experienced a 1.28-fold increased risk of post procedural  myocardial  infarction  (2.87%  vs 2.25%  for  those  receiving  alternative  drugeluting stents) (Recommendations for a National Medical Device Evaluation System).

standard rate, funnel plot shows which devices  can  be  called  'outlier'.  Details  of the  calculation  of  funnel  plot  values  for standardized ratio data are as follows:

Assume  a  standardi zed  ratio  SR  =  O  /  E  based on  an  observed  count  O  and  expected  count  E, where  E  is  defined  as  number  expected  on  the basis  of  the  product  of  national  device  failure rate  and  the  patient  time  at  risk.  We  assume  an expected or target ratio t. A square root transformation is applied to both standardized ratio (y), and the target (t):

y =âO (O/E)

t = âO(t)

The standard error(s) is given by s 2 = [1/(4*E)] Thus,  the  unadjusted  transformed  Z -score  is:  z = (y - t) / â(s 2

Like several other methods, this approach is heavily  dependent  on  assumptions  about equivalent underlying risk. If there is heterogeneity in the underlying risk (as might occur with differing standards of care across sites, differing expertise of operators, or differing disease progression among patients between sites), then departures outside the limits may be more reflective of issues  with  the  assumptions  broadly,  than with  issues  in  the  performance  of  those points  outside  the  limits.    Also,  for  funnel plots  in  particular  the  performance  may  be  somewhat  suspect  for  extremes  in  the  x-axis. Values close to zero (very little use) have extreme variability, while high values of the xaxis can contribute an excess proportion to the determination of what constitutes an outlier (since that determination is based on all of the data).

When considering how to screen registry data across sources in a coordinated fashion, it can be  very  helpful  to think  about  what  patterns of  potential  signals  are of  interest,  and  what data might be made available to investigate those patterns.  Signal detection approaches can generally be categorized into four broad groups: separation, heterogeneity, exclusion, and deviation.  This taxonomy for signal detection was previously introduced in the white paper 'Recommendations for a National Medical Device Evaluation System'.

the

Table 2.  A Taxonomy for Signal Detection

| Type          | Purpose                                                                                                                            | Example                                                                                                                                       |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Separation    | Identify divergence between two devices                                                                                            | Is the adverse event rate following drug eluting stenting different from that following bare metal stenting?                                  |
| Heterogeneity | Determine if and when one process differs from a collection of processes                                                           | If and when does the average post-implant infection rate for Surgeon Adiffer from the average infection rate for all surgeons in the country? |
| Exclusion     | Determine when a signal is sufficiently refined that a threshold value may be excluded, even if the process is relatively constant | When does the average hospital mortality following implantation of a left ventricular assist device in Hospital A exceed 15%?                 |
| Deviation     | Determine if and when a single process leaves a pre- defined area of acceptability                                                 | If and when does the incidence of inappropriate shocks by implantable cardioverter/defibrillators leads exceed x?                             |

Note  that differing signal detection  approaches may  allow  one  to compensate  for differences  observed  across  separate  countries.    For  example,  it  may  be  that  different reporting  requirements  might  be  expected  to  yield  differing  absolute  rates  of  reported events  for  the  same  device  across  different  countries.    However,  if  the  proportional difference  in  reporting  rates  was  constant  on  an  additive  scale  (possibly  obtained  via  log transformation if it was originally constant on a multiplicative scale), then the difference in rates between two competing devices might be expected to be comparable across multiple countries.  In this example, separation might be more justifiable than heterogeneity, as the later might be more reflective of country differences than true device differences.

Alternatively,  one  could  conceive  of  scenarios  where  aligning  around  a  similar  signal process could necessitate application of differing (absolute) threshold values.  For example, suppose that differing countries had differing base mortality rates, but they were interesting in  comparing  departures  from  the  (separate)  base  mortality  in  a  consistent  fashion.    One might construct a monitoring plan that allowed for a departure of plus or minus 5% from baseline  mortality,  so  that  the  width  of  the  acceptability  corridor  was  constant  across countries  even  when  the  underlying  rates  differ.    This  would  be  a  variant  of  a  signal detection process that has previously been used to examine deaths as linked to numbers of operations.

## 9.0 General Recommendations

- Recommendations regarding international coordination in methodology 9.1 that  would  add  value  to  multiple  international  stakeholders  including regulators include:
- a. Leveraging  IMDRF  work  already  in  progress  (unique  device  identification adoption,  creation  of  standard  common  data  elements,  defining  a  code  set  for patient and device problems associated with adverse events) to reduce variation in  the  data  being  exchanged  between  registries  would  improve  data  analysis accuracy and signal detection;
- b. Advancing  coordination  in  addressing  important  questions  that  are  difficult  to resolve within a single country registry;
- c. The proposed international  methodological pilots could be a vehicle  for further convergence of methodological approaches
- Recommendations regarding methodological principles in clinical 9.2 evaluation  of  performance,  effectiveness  and  safety  across  the  device lifecycle,  including  signal  detection,  using  international  Coordinated Registry Networks (iCRNs) include:
- a. The process should exist by which important information and data (on either a summary level or observation  level) will  be shared in a structured fashion by regulators  across  multiple  countries.    This  process  should  be  agreed  upon before analyses are performed.
- b. Where appropriate, registry structure should be leveraged to efficiently answer questions  that  would  have  historically  been  addressed  via  more  resource intensive legacy tools  (e.g. 522 studies in the US, PASS studies in EU);
- c. Registries  should  be  exploited  to  facilitate  the  conduct  of  clinical  trials  both premarket and postmarket;
- d. Separation  within  and  between  country  variation  for  analysis  is  necessary  in order to ensure effective individual and international decision making . Explicit modeling  to  help  determine  factors  influencing  the  within-  and  betweencountry variability would be useful;
- e. Pre-specification of analyses that could drive regulatory decisions is essential. Beyond the direct specification of analyses, effort should be devoted towards construction  of  a  verification  and  reproducibility  plans  for  findings  from  the analyses driven by models;

- f. Further consideration should be given to assessing optimal role of spontaneous adverse event reporting in the context of iCRNs.

## 10.0 Pilot Projects

The  following  methodological  pilot  projects  could  be  a  vehicle  of  addressing  important regulatory questions:

- a. Pooling  Data  for  Regulatory  Decisions  in  International    Coordinated  Registry Network (iCRN)
- b. Statistical Approaches for Informing the Device Total Product Life Cycle Internationally
- c. Piloting  PASSION/RAPID  Global  Case  Report  Form  for  Peripheral  Vascular Devices in International CRN as Infrastructure to Nested Clinical Trial

## Statistical Approaches for Informing the Device Total Product Life Cycle Internationally

The  availability  of  international  registries  may  allow  for  shifting  some  premarket  device data  collection  requirements  to the  postmarket  setting,  this  shift  requires  the  use  of  valid and reliable data elements that reflect the outcomes of interest in well-defined populations.

3. Stakeholders engaged

Regulators, industry, academia, payers, patient representatives from example device area and CRN component registry owner representatives.

4. Existing international resources leveraged

Methodology  illustrated  using  existing  international  registries and consortia such as ICOR, ICCR, ICVR, ICOBRA. Stakeholder  utility  banks  could  be  constructed  and  leveraged for future device assessments.

5. Efficiencies promoted

Study results will indicate how to develop more efficient ways to  assess  data  elements  in  various  data  sources  including patient reported outcomes and preferences.

## Piloting PASSION/RAPID Global Case Report Form for Peripheral Vascular Devices in International CRN as Infrastructure to Nested Clinical Trial

The  MDEpiNet  PASSION  (Predictable  and  Sustainable  Implementation  of  National) Registries  RAPID  program  successfully  developed  data  collection  tool  consisting  of  100 well specified Common Data Elements (CDEs) including the Device Identifier (DI) pf the UDI and data elements from the US  Global Unique Device Identification Database based upon  IMDRF.  Via  transparent  and  well  documented  multi-stakeholder  engagement  this effort  has  established  the  international  infrastructure  that  can  be  used  for  both  premarket and postmarket clinical studies and surveillance.

1. Disease/device focus

Peripheral  vascular  devices  (see  the  examples  of  proposed priority areas)

2. Immediate research question(s)

Can  international CRNs  be  successfully  used  for  nesting clinical trials?
