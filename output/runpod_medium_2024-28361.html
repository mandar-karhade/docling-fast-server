<p>Marketing Submission</p>
<p>Recommendations for a Predetermined Change Control Plan for Artificial Intelligence-Enabled Device Software Functions; Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff; Availability</p>
<p>AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS.</p>
<p>ACTION: Notice of availability.</p>
<p>SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA, Agency, or we) is announcing the availability of a final guidance entitled ''Marketing Submission Recommendations for a Predetermined Change Control Plan for Artificial Intelligence-Enabled Device Software Functions.'' This guidance demonstrates FDA's commitment to developing innovative approaches to the regulation of artificial intelligence (AI)enabled devices. More specifically, this guidance provides recommendations on the information to include in a Predetermined Change Control Plan (PCCP) in a marketing submission for a device that includes one or more AIenabled device software functions (AIDSFs). This guidance recommends that a PCCP describe the planned AI-DSF modifications, the associated methodology to develop, validate, and implement those modifications, and an assessment of the impact of those modifications. FDA reviews the PCCP as part of a marketing submission for a device to ensure the continued safety and effectiveness of the device without necessitating additional marketing submissions for implementing each modification described in the PCCP.</p>
<p>DATES: The announcement of the guidance is published in the Federal Register on December 4, 2024.</p>

<h2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</h2>
<h2>I. Background</h2>
<p>FDA has a longstanding commitment to develop and apply innovative approaches to the regulation of medical device software and other digital health technologies to ensure their safety and effectiveness. As technology continues to advance all facets of healthcare, medical software incorporating AI, including the subset of AI known as machine learning (ML), has become an important part of many medical devices. In April 2019, FDA published the ''Proposed Regulatory Framework for Modifications to Artificial Intelligence/ Machine Learning (AI/ML)-Based Software as a Medical Device (SaMD)Discussion Paper and Request for Feedback.'' 1 The 2019 discussion paper received a substantial amount of feedback from a wide array of interested parties that contributed to the development of the draft of this guidance.</p>
<p>On December 29, 2022, section 3308 of the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022, Title III of Division FF of</p>
<p>1 Available at https://www.fda.gov/media/ 122535/download?attachment, and also at FDA's website on ''Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Software as a Medical Device,'' available at https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/ software-medical-device-samd/artificialintelligence-and-machine-learning-softwaremedical-device.</p>
<p>the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 (FDORA) (Pub. L. 117-328), added section 515C ''Predetermined Change Control Plans for Devices'' to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (FD&amp;C) Act (21 U.S.C. 360e-4). Section 515C of the FD&amp;C Act has provisions regarding PCCPs for devices requiring premarket approval (PMA) or premarket notification (510(k)). While under the FD&amp;C Act FDA may approve or clear a PCCP for a variety of devices, this guidance provides recommendations specifically for PCCPs for AI-DSFs.</p>
<p>A notice of availability of the draft guidance, under the title ''Marketing Submission Recommendations for a Predetermined Change Control Plan for Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML)-Enabled Device Software Functions,'' appeared in the Federal Register of April 3, 2023 (88 FR 19648). FDA considered comments received and revised the guidance as appropriate in response to the comments, including the title. In this final guidance, FDA provides additional clarification throughout, including related to the scope of the guidance, information related to the PCCP to include in labeling and publicly available decision summaries, implementation of a modification to a device consistent with an authorized PCCP, and postmarket surveillance recommendations. We revised the definitions of the terms ''artificial intelligence'' and ''machine learning'' to align with definitions in Executive Order 14110 of October 30, 2023. 2 In response to comments received, we also clarified other terminology used in the guidance, including clarifications for training, tuning, and test data.</p>
<p>This final guidance represents the Agency's next step in working to develop innovative approaches tailored to AI-enabled devices. These recommendations are based on the statutory authorities provided in the FD&amp;C Act, including the provisions added by FDORA, as well as feedback obtained through our various interactions with interested parties and through public comment on the draft of this guidance. The recommendations in this guidance are intended to provide a forward-thinking approach to promote the development of safe and effective AI-enabled devices.</p>
<p>This guidance provides recommendations on the information to include in a PCCP in a marketing submission for a device that includes</p>
<p>2 E.O. 14110 of October 30, 2023, Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence, available at https:// www.federalregister.gov/d/2023-24283.</p>
<p>VerDate Sep&lt;11&gt;2014</p>
<p>17:36 Dec 03, 2024</p>
<p>Jkt 265001</p>
<p>PO 00000</p>
<p>one or more AI-DSFs. The guidance recommends that a PCCP describe the planned AI-DSF modifications, the associated methodology to develop, validate, and implement those modifications, and an assessment of the impact of those modifications. FDA reviews the PCCP as part of a marketing submission for a device to ensure the continued safety and effectiveness of the device without necessitating additional marketing submissions for implementing each modification described in the PCCP.</p>
<p>This guidance is being issued consistent with FDA's good guidance practices regulation (21 CFR 10.115). The guidance represents the current thinking of FDA on ''Marketing Submission Recommendations for a Predetermined Change Control Plan for Artificial Intelligence-Enabled Device Software Functions.'' It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations.</p>

<p>Notifying the Food and Drug Administration of a Permanent Discontinuance in the Manufacture or an Interruption of the Manufacture of an Infant Formula; Draft Guidance for Industry; Availability; Agency Information Collection Activities; Proposed Collection; Comment Request</p>
<p>AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS.</p>
<p>ACTION: Notice of availability.</p>
<p>SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or we) is announcing the availability of a draft guidance for industry entitled ''Notifying FDA of a Permanent Discontinuance in the Manufacture or an Interruption of the Manufacture of an Infant Formula.'' Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&amp;C Act), a manufacturer of a critical food (which includes infant formula) must notify FDA of a permanent discontinuance or an interruption of the manufacture of a critical food that is likely to lead to a meaningful disruption in the supply of the food in the United States. The draft guidance, when finalized, is intended to help the infant formula industry comply with this notification requirement as it pertains to infant formula.</p>
