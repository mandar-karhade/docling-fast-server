Preface\n\nThe document herein was produced by the International Medical Device Regulators Forum (IMDRF), a voluntary group of medical device regulators from around the world.  The document has been subject to consultation throughout its development.\n\nThere are no restrictions on the reproduction, distribution or use of this document; however, incorporation of this document, in part or in whole, into any other document, or its translation into languages other than English, does not convey or represent an endorsement of any kind by the International Medical Device Regulators Forum.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis is one document in a collection of documents produced by the International Medical Device Regulators Forum (IMDRF) intended to implement the concept of a Medical Device Single Audit Program (MDSAP).  Two documents, IMDRF/MDSAP WG/N3 - 'Requirements for Medical Device Auditing Organizations for Regulatory Authority Recognition' and IMDRF/MDSAP WG/N4 - 'Competence and Training Requirements for Auditing Organizations,' are complementary documents.  These two documents N3 and N4 are focused on requirements for an Auditing Organization and individuals performing regulatory audits and other related functions under the respective medical device legislation, regulations, and procedures required in its regulatory jurisdiction.\n\nThree additional documents, IMDRF/MDSAP WG/N5 - 'Regulatory Authority Assessment Method for the Recognition and Monitoring of Medical Device Auditing Organizations,' IMDRF/MDSAP WG/N8  - 'Guidance for Regulatory Authority Assessors on the Method of Assessment for MDSAP Auditing Organizations' and IMDRF/MDSAP WG/N6 - 'Regulatory Authority Assessor Competence and Training Requirements,' are complementary documents. These three documents N5, N6, and N8 are focused on how Regulatory Authorities and their assessors will evaluate, or 'assess', a medical device Auditing Organizations' compliance to the requirements in the IMDRF MDSAP N3 and N4 documents.\n\nIn addition, IMDRF/MDSAP WG/N11 - 'MDSAP Assessment and Decision for the Recognition of an Auditing Organization' - defines a method to 'grade' nonconformities resulting from a Regulatory Authority assessment of an Auditing Organization and to document the decision process for recognizing an Auditing Organization or revoking recognition.\n\nThis document IMDRF/MDSAP WG/N24 describes the format and content of MDSAP medical device regulatory audit reports submitted to Regulatory Authorities. The audit report serves as a written record of the audit team's determination of the extent of fulfillment of specified requirements. It also serves to demonstrate the application of the rules of the recognized Auditing Organization's conformity assessment scheme. It enables the Auditing Organization to capture in a consistent manner the evidence of a manufacturer's conformity with the audit criteria for the MDSAP audit, and will facilitate the exchange of information between Regulatory Authorities.  The Regulatory Authorities that participate in the IMDRF agree that this document is to be used instead of the Global Harmonization Task Force (GHTF) SG4/N33 R16 document entitled, 'Guidelines for Regulatory Auditing of Quality Management Systems of Medical Device Manufacturers - Part 3: Regulatory Audit Reports.'\n\nThis collection of IMDRF MDSAP documents provide the fundamental building blocks by providing a common set of requirements to be utilized by the Regulatory Authorities for the recognition and monitoring of entities that perform regulatory audits and other related functions. It should be noted that in some jurisdictions the recognition process is called designation, notification, registration, or accreditation.\n\nIMDRF developed MDSAP to encourage and support global convergence of regulatory systems, where possible.  It seeks to strike a balance between the responsibilities of Regulatory\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nAuthorities to safeguard the health of their citizens as well as their obligations to avoid placing unnecessary burdens upon Auditing Organizations or the regulated industry.  IMDRF Regulatory Authorities may add additional requirements beyond this document when their legislation requires such additions.\n\nTo prevent the confusion between audits of manufacturers performed by auditors within an Auditing Organizations and audits of Auditing Organizations performed by medical device Regulatory Authority assessors, in this document, the latter are designated as 'assessments.'\n\n## 1.0 Scope\n\nThe scope of this guidance document is limited to the information that participating MDSAP Regulatory Authorities require in medical device regulatory audit reports, the format of reports and the information necessary for participating MDSAP Regulatory Authorities to effectively use the audit reports in accordance with their legislation.\n\nThe Auditing Organization shall utilize this reporting model for all audits other than Stage 1. For a Surveillance or Special Audit, it shall record in detail the applicable elements audited and identify those elements not within the scope of the audit.\n\n## 2.0 References\n\nIn addition to the definitions below, the definitions found in the following documents apply:\n\nIMDRF/MDSAP WG/N3 - Requirements for Medical Device Auditing Organizations for Regulatory Authority Recognition\n\nIMDRF/MDSAP WG/N4 - Competency and Training Requirements for Auditing Organizations\n\nGHTF/SG3/N19:2012 - Nonconformity Grading System for Regulatory Purposes and Information Exchange\n\nISO 9000:2005 - Quality management systems - Fundamentals and vocabulary\n\nISO/IEC 17000:2004 - Conformity assessment - Vocabulary and general principles\n\nISO/IEC 17021:2011 - Conformity assessment -Requirements for bodies providing audit and certification of management systems\n\n## 3.0 Definitions\n\n## Auditing Organization (AO)\n\nAn organization that audits a medical device manufacturer for conformity with quality management system requirements and other medical device regulatory requirements.

(IMDRF/MDSAP WG/N3)\n\n## Manufacturer\n\nAny natural or legal person 1 with responsibility for design and/or manufacture of a medical device with the intention of making the medical device available for use, under his name; whether or not such a medical device is designed and/or manufactured by that person himself or on his behalf by another person(s).\n\nNotes:\n\n1. This 'natural or legal person' has ultimate legal responsibility for ensuring compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements for the medical device in the countries or jurisdictions where it is intended to be made available or sold, unless this responsibility is specifically imposed on another person by the Regulatory Authority (RA) within that jurisdiction.\n2. The manufacturer's responsibilities include meeting both pre-market requirements and post-market requirements, such as adverse event reporting and notification of corrective actions.\n3. 'Design and/or manufacture', as referred to in the above definition, may include specification development, production, fabrication, assembly, processing, packaging, repackaging, labeling, relabeling, sterilization, installation, or remanufacturing of a medical device; or putting a collection of devices, and possibly other products, together for a medical purpose.\n4. Any person who assembles or adapts a medical device that has already been supplied by another person for an individual patient, in accordance with the instructions for use, is not the manufacturer, provided the assembly or adaptation does not change the intended use of the medical device.\n5. Any person who changes the intended use of, or modifies, a medical device without acting on behalf of the original manufacturer and who makes it available for use under his own name, should be considered the manufacturer of the modified medical device.\n6. An authorized representative, distributor or importer who only adds its own address and contact details to the medical device or the packaging, without covering or changing the existing labeling, is not considered a manufacturer.\n7. To the extent that an accessory is subject to the regulatory requirements of a medical device, the person responsible for the design and/or manufacture of that accessory is considered to be a manufacturer.\n\n(GHTF/SG1/N055: 2009)\n\n1 The term 'person' that appears here includes legal entities such as a corporation, a partnership or an association.\n\n2 October 2015\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n## 4.0 Guidance for Implementation\n\n## 4.1 Report Language\n\nFor the MDSAP, all audit reports shall be available in English.\n\nIt is preferable that report authors prepare reports using the grammatical form of 'active voice' using first person (with the identification of the first person when there are multiple authors) and the past tense. Active voice ensures that the focus of a sentence is on the correct subject, reducing ambiguity and improving clarity.  First person ensures the specific individual responsible for an audit activity or audit finding can be identified. The language should be unambiguous, concise, self-explanatory and clarifying that any finding is linked to a requirement.\n\n## 4.2 Report Content\n\n## 4.2.1 Information about the Manufacturer\n\nThe following items should be included in the report:\n\n## (A) Manufacturer's Name and Address\n\nThe report should include the name and full address of the manufacturer subject to the audit.\n\nNote: it is recommended that the manufacturer's name and address is consistent with what appears on a certification document, and if applicable any Regulatory Authority registration.\n\n## (B) Audited Facility's Name and Address\n\nThe report should include the name and full address of the audited facility subject to an audit plan.  If this audit plan covers several facilities, then the name and full address of each facility shall be recorded in both the audit plan and the audit report.\n\nNote: Regardless of the number of facilities audited, each audit plan has a corresponding audit report.\n\n## (C) Manufacturer Identification Number\n\nIf assigned by a recognizing Regulatory Authority, the manufacturer's identification numbers (e.g. DUNS number) for the site audited should be included in the audit report.  The audit report shall clearly reference the manufacturer and the relationship of the audited facility to the manufacturer.\n\n## (D) Corporate Structure of the Manufacturer\n\nThe report should comprehensively explain the corporate structure and the relationship between the corporate's entities in the context of their QMS, and the associated scope of manufacturing activities and devices.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n## (E) Contact Person\n\nThe name and contact information of the manufacturer's nominated point of contact should be included in the report.\n\n## (F) Last audit\n\nThe report shall include the date of the last audit of the audited facility, and any identifier for the corresponding audit report.  If this is the initial audit of the manufacturer, this must be stated in the report.\n\n## (G) Description of the audited facility\n\nA description of the audited facility should include:\n\n- -the name and title of senior management of the audited facility including the most responsible individual for the audited facility\n- -the name and title of the senior manager responsible for the quality management system at the audited facility.\n- -the approximate number of employees\n- -number of shifts\n- -number of buildings, if applicable\n- -an overview of the activities and processes\n- -identification of outsourced activities\n\nIf there are multiple facilities audited, the following should be considered:\n\n- -when there is one audit plan and one audit report, the above description shall be clearly described in the audit report for each facility; and,\n- -certain recognizing Regulatory Authorities may require that separate reports be issued for each audited facility.\n\nFor surveillance or special audit reports the description of the audited facility may be limited to those parts that fall within the scope of the audit.\n\n## (H) Scope of MDSAP Certification\n\nThe report should include the scope applied for, or the existing scope of MDSAP certification of the manufacturer. This includes activities and a list of the generic medical device groups or families that are included in the scope of MDSAP certification. The report may refer to an appendix when the scope of certification is extensive.\n\n## (I) Identification of Critical Suppliers\n\nThe report shall include a list of critical suppliers, their legal name, full address, product or service provided, and if applicable, any changes to  those suppliers identified as critical suppliers since the previous audit.

For audits performed in accordance with the MDSAP, this would normally include, as a minimum, the applicable regulatory requirements for the participating Regulatory Authorities.\n\n## (C) Audit Objectives\n\nThe report should list the audit objectives. This includes, as a minimum, the evaluation of:\n\n- -the effectiveness of the manufacturer's QMS incorporating the applicable regulatory requirements (see IMDRF/MDSAP WG/N3 9.2.4, 9.3.2 and 9.4.1);\n- -product/process related technologies (e.g. injection molding, sterilization) (see IMDRF/MDSAP WG/N3 9.2.4 and 9.4.1);\n- -adequate product technical documentation in relation to relevant regulatory requirements (see IMDRF/MDSAP WG/N3 9.2.4 and 9.4.1);\n- -new or changed product/process related technologies (e.g. injection molding, sterilization) (see IMDRF/MDSAP WG/N3 9.3.2);\n- -new or amended product technical documentation in relation to relevant regulatory requirements (see IMDRF/MDSAP WG/N3 9.3.2); and\n- -the manufacturer's ability to comply with these requirements (see IMDRF/MDSAP WG/N3 9.2.4, 9.3.2 and 9.4.1).\n\n## (D) Audit Scope\n\nThe report shall describe the activities and processes that form the scope of the audit.\n\n## (E) Audit Dates and Auditor Days\n\nThe audit report shall include the dates of the on-site audit, and the total number of auditor days for each audited facility within the audit plan.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n## (F) Identification of the Audit Team\n\nThe report shall identify all members of the audit team (name, title, affiliation) and describe their respective role (e.g. team leader, technical expert, etc.), the identity of any interpreter and their affiliation, and the identity of any observers present.\n\n## (G) Audit Language\n\nThe report shall indicate the language or languages used during the audit.\n\n## (H) Stage 1 Audit Results\n\nWhen elements of Stage 1 and Stage 2 audits are combined during a single on-site audit of the manufacturer, the report should include a clear description of the Stage 1 elements covered during the audit.\n\n## (I) Audit Plan\n\nThe report should include a copy of the audit plan. The report should document and explain the reason for any deviations from the audit plan.\n\nNote: For additional guidance on the content of the audit plan, see ISO/IEC 17021 9.1.2. and Annex F.\n\n## (J) Description of Major Changes Identified by the Manufacturer\n\nThe report should record when the manufacturer identifies an activity or process, that is to be audited, has been subject to a major change. This includes major changes to products or processes, changes to the organizational structure or ownership, changes to key personnel and facilities and to the QMS as a whole.\n\n## 4.2.3 Audit Evidence\n\nThe audit report should include sufficient audit evidence to support the audit conclusions made in the report. The auditor should document audit evidence, evaluate the evidence against audit criteria and determine a finding, either of conformity or nonconformity. Information regarding the verification of the specific requirements from participating Regulatory Authorities should be included in the audit report.\n\nThe Auditing Organization should note that the participating MDSAP Regulatory Authorities will conclude that the Auditing Organization did not audit an aspect or process of the manufacturer's QMS if omitted in the report. If a process of the manufacturer's QMS that is required to be audited by the audit type (e.g. initial, surveillance, re-audit) is not audited, the report should contain the rationale for not auditing the process.\n\nThe report should record both findings of conformity and nonconformity. Report authors should refrain from providing specific advice, instructions or solutions towards the development and implementation of a QMS, or from suggesting opportunities for improvement (see IMDRF/MDSAP WG/N3 - 9.1.3).\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n## 4.2.4 Audit Summaries\n\nWritten summaries of the audit of each of the processes or activities below should be included in the report.

The document has been subject to consultation throughout its development.</p>\n<p>There are no restrictions on the reproduction, distribution or use of this document; however, incorporation of this document, in part or in whole, into any other document, or its translation into languages other than English, does not convey or represent an endorsement of any kind by the International Medical Device Regulators Forum.</p>\n<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>This is one document in a collection of documents produced by the International Medical Device Regulators Forum (IMDRF) intended to implement the concept of a Medical Device Single Audit Program (MDSAP).  Two documents, IMDRF/MDSAP WG/N3 - 'Requirements for Medical Device Auditing Organizations for Regulatory Authority Recognition' and IMDRF/MDSAP WG/N4 - 'Competence and Training Requirements for Auditing Organizations,' are complementary documents.  These two documents N3 and N4 are focused on requirements for an Auditing Organization and individuals performing regulatory audits and other related functions under the respective medical device legislation, regulations, and procedures required in its regulatory jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>Three additional documents, IMDRF/MDSAP WG/N5 - 'Regulatory Authority Assessment Method for the Recognition and Monitoring of Medical Device Auditing Organizations,' IMDRF/MDSAP WG/N8  - 'Guidance for Regulatory Authority Assessors on the Method of Assessment for MDSAP Auditing Organizations' and IMDRF/MDSAP WG/N6 - 'Regulatory Authority Assessor Competence and Training Requirements,' are complementary documents. These three documents N5, N6, and N8 are focused on how Regulatory Authorities and their assessors will evaluate, or 'assess', a medical device Auditing Organizations' compliance to the requirements in the IMDRF MDSAP N3 and N4 documents.</p>\n<p>In addition, IMDRF/MDSAP WG/N11 - 'MDSAP Assessment and Decision for the Recognition of an Auditing Organization' - defines a method to 'grade' nonconformities resulting from a Regulatory Authority assessment of an Auditing Organization and to document the decision process for recognizing an Auditing Organization or revoking recognition.</p>\n<p>This document IMDRF/MDSAP WG/N24 describes the format and content of MDSAP medical device regulatory audit reports submitted to Regulatory Authorities. The audit report serves as a written record of the audit team's determination of the extent of fulfillment of specified requirements. It also serves to demonstrate the application of the rules of the recognized Auditing Organization's conformity assessment scheme. It enables the Auditing Organization to capture in a consistent manner the evidence of a manufacturer's conformity with the audit criteria for the MDSAP audit, and will facilitate the exchange of information between Regulatory Authorities.  The Regulatory Authorities that participate in the IMDRF agree that this document is to be used instead of the Global Harmonization Task Force (GHTF) SG4/N33 R16 document entitled, 'Guidelines for Regulatory Auditing of Quality Management Systems of Medical Device Manufacturers - Part 3: Regulatory Audit Reports.'</p>\n<p>This collection of IMDRF MDSAP documents provide the fundamental building blocks by providing a common set of requirements to be utilized by the Regulatory Authorities for the recognition and monitoring of entities that perform regulatory audits and other related functions. It should be noted that in some jurisdictions the recognition process is called designation, notification, registration, or accreditation.</p>\n<p>IMDRF developed MDSAP to encourage and support global convergence of regulatory systems, where possible.  It seeks to strike a balance between the responsibilities of Regulatory</p>\n<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>\n<p>Authorities to safeguard the health of their citizens as well as their obligations to avoid placing unnecessary burdens upon Auditing Organizations or the regulated industry.  IMDRF Regulatory Authorities may add additional requirements beyond this document when their legislation requires such additions.</p>\n<p>To prevent the confusion between audits of manufacturers performed by auditors within an Auditing Organizations and audits of Auditing Organizations performed by medical device Regulatory Authority assessors, in this document, the latter are designated as 'assessments.'</p>\n<h2>1.0 Scope</h2>\n<p>The scope of this guidance document is limited to the information that participating MDSAP Regulatory Authorities require in medical device regulatory audit reports, the format of reports and the information necessary for participating MDSAP Regulatory Authorities to effectively use the audit reports in accordance with their legislation.</p>\n<p>The Auditing Organization shall utilize this reporting model for all audits other than Stage 1. For a Surveillance or Special Audit, it shall record in detail the applicable elements audited and identify those elements not within the scope of the audit.</p>\n<h2>2.0 References</h2>\n<p>In addition to the definitions below, the definitions found in the following documents apply:</p>\n<p>IMDRF/MDSAP WG/N3 - Requirements for Medical Device Auditing Organizations for Regulatory Authority Recognition</p>\n<p>IMDRF/MDSAP WG/N4 - Competency and Training Requirements for Auditing Organizations</p>\n<p>GHTF/SG3/N19:2012 - Nonconformity Grading System for Regulatory Purposes and Information Exchange</p>\n<p>ISO 9000:2005 - Quality management systems - Fundamentals and vocabulary</p>\n<p>ISO/IEC 17000:2004 - Conformity assessment - Vocabulary and general principles</p>\n<p>ISO/IEC 17021:2011 - Conformity assessment -Requirements for bodies providing audit and certification of management systems</p>\n<h2>3.0 Definitions</h2>\n<h2>Auditing Organization (AO)</h2>\n<p>An organization that audits a medical device manufacturer for conformity with quality management system requirements and other medical device regulatory requirements. Auditing</p>\n<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>\n<p>organizations may be an independent organization or a Regulatory Authority which performs regulatory audits. (IMDRF/MDSAP WG/N3)</p>\n<h2>Manufacturer</h2>\n<p>Any natural or legal person 1 with responsibility for design and/or manufacture of a medical device with the intention of making the medical device available for use, under his name; whether or not such a medical device is designed and/or manufactured by that person himself or on his behalf by another person(s).</p>\n<p>Notes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: '1. ';\">This 'natural or legal person' has ultimate legal responsibility for ensuring compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements for the medical device in the countries or jurisdictions where it is intended to be made available or sold, unless this responsibility is specifically imposed on another person by the Regulatory Authority (RA) within that jurisdiction.</li>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: '2. ';\">The manufacturer's responsibilities include meeting both pre-market requirements and post-market requirements, such as adverse event reporting and notification of corrective actions.</li>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: '3. ';\">'Design and/or manufacture', as referred to in the above definition, may include specification development, production, fabrication, assembly, processing, packaging, repackaging, labeling, relabeling, sterilization, installation, or remanufacturing of a medical device; or putting a collection of devices, and possibly other products, together for a medical purpose.</li>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: '4. ';\">Any person who assembles or adapts a medical device that has already been supplied by another person for an individual patient, in accordance with the instructions for use, is not the manufacturer, provided the assembly or adaptation does not change the intended use of the medical device.</li>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: '5.

Active voice ensures that the focus of a sentence is on the correct subject, reducing ambiguity and improving clarity.  First person ensures the specific individual responsible for an audit activity or audit finding can be identified. The language should be unambiguous, concise, self-explanatory and clarifying that any finding is linked to a requirement.</p>\n<h2>4.2 Report Content</h2>\n<h2>4.2.1 Information about the Manufacturer</h2>\n<p>The following items should be included in the report:</p>\n<h2>(A) Manufacturer's Name and Address</h2>\n<p>The report should include the name and full address of the manufacturer subject to the audit.</p>\n<p>Note: it is recommended that the manufacturer's name and address is consistent with what appears on a certification document, and if applicable any Regulatory Authority registration.</p>\n<h2>(B) Audited Facility's Name and Address</h2>\n<p>The report should include the name and full address of the audited facility subject to an audit plan.  If this audit plan covers several facilities, then the name and full address of each facility shall be recorded in both the audit plan and the audit report.</p>\n<p>Note: Regardless of the number of facilities audited, each audit plan has a corresponding audit report.</p>\n<h2>(C) Manufacturer Identification Number</h2>\n<p>If assigned by a recognizing Regulatory Authority, the manufacturer's identification numbers (e.g. DUNS number) for the site audited should be included in the audit report.  The audit report shall clearly reference the manufacturer and the relationship of the audited facility to the manufacturer.</p>\n<h2>(D) Corporate Structure of the Manufacturer</h2>\n<p>The report should comprehensively explain the corporate structure and the relationship between the corporate's entities in the context of their QMS, and the associated scope of manufacturing activities and devices.</p>\n<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>\n<h2>(E) Contact Person</h2>\n<p>The name and contact information of the manufacturer's nominated point of contact should be included in the report.</p>\n<h2>(F) Last audit</h2>\n<p>The report shall include the date of the last audit of the audited facility, and any identifier for the corresponding audit report.  If this is the initial audit of the manufacturer, this must be stated in the report.</p>\n<h2>(G) Description of the audited facility</h2>\n<p>A description of the audited facility should include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>-the name and title of senior management of the audited facility including the most responsible individual for the audited facility</li>\n<li>-the name and title of the senior manager responsible for the quality management system at the audited facility.</li>\n<li>-the approximate number of employees</li>\n<li>-number of shifts</li>\n<li>-number of buildings, if applicable</li>\n<li>-an overview of the activities and processes</li>\n<li>-identification of outsourced activities</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If there are multiple facilities audited, the following should be considered:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>-when there is one audit plan and one audit report, the above description shall be clearly described in the audit report for each facility; and,</li>\n<li>-certain recognizing Regulatory Authorities may require that separate reports be issued for each audited facility.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For surveillance or special audit reports the description of the audited facility may be limited to those parts that fall within the scope of the audit.</p>\n<h2>(H) Scope of MDSAP Certification</h2>\n<p>The report should include the scope applied for, or the existing scope of MDSAP certification of the manufacturer. This includes activities and a list of the generic medical device groups or families that are included in the scope of MDSAP certification. The report may refer to an appendix when the scope of certification is extensive.</p>\n<h2>(I) Identification of Critical Suppliers</h2>\n<p>The report shall include a list of critical suppliers, their legal name, full address, product or service provided, and if applicable, any changes to  those suppliers identified as critical suppliers since the previous audit. The list may be an appendix to the report.</p>\n<h2>(J) Jurisdictions</h2>\n<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>\n<p>The report should include the list of jurisdictions taken into account for the audit, i.e. jurisdictions to which the manufacturer is seeking or maintains marketing authorization.</p>\n<h2>4.2.2 Information about the Audit</h2>\n<p>The audit report should describe in adequate detail the nature of the audit performed and the following items:</p>\n<h2>(A) Audit Type</h2>\n<p>The report should identify the type of audit performed (for example, initial audit, surveillance, re-audit/re-certification audit, and special audit) See IMDRF/MDSAP WG/N3</p>\n<h2>(B) Audit Criteria</h2>\n<p>The report should list the audit criteria. For audits performed in accordance with the MDSAP, this would normally include, as a minimum, the applicable regulatory requirements for the participating Regulatory Authorities.</p>\n<h2>(C) Audit Objectives</h2>\n<p>The report should list the audit objectives. This includes, as a minimum, the evaluation of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>-the effectiveness of the manufacturer's QMS incorporating the applicable regulatory requirements (see IMDRF/MDSAP WG/N3 9.2.4, 9.3.2 and 9.4.1);</li>\n<li>-product/process related technologies (e.g. injection molding, sterilization) (see IMDRF/MDSAP WG/N3 9.2.4 and 9.4.1);</li>\n<li>-adequate product technical documentation in relation to relevant regulatory requirements (see IMDRF/MDSAP WG/N3 9.2.4 and 9.4.1);</li>\n<li>-new or changed product/process related technologies (e.g. injection molding, sterilization) (see IMDRF/MDSAP WG/N3 9.3.2);</li>\n<li>-new or amended product technical documentation in relation to relevant regulatory requirements (see IMDRF/MDSAP WG/N3 9.3.2); and</li>\n<li>-the manufacturer's ability to comply with these requirements (see IMDRF/MDSAP WG/N3 9.2.4, 9.3.2 and 9.4.1).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>(D) Audit Scope</h2>\n<p>The report shall describe the activities and processes that form the scope of the audit.</p>\n<h2>(E) Audit Dates and Auditor Days</h2>\n<p>The audit report shall include the dates of the on-site audit, and the total number of auditor days for each audited facility within the audit plan.</p>\n<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>\n<h2>(F) Identification of the Audit Team</h2>\n<p>The report shall identify all members of the audit team (name, title, affiliation) and describe their respective role (e.g. team leader, technical expert, etc.), the identity of any interpreter and their affiliation, and the identity of any observers present.</p>\n<h2>(G) Audit Language</h2>\n<p>The report shall indicate the language or languages used during the audit.</p>\n<h2>(H) Stage 1 Audit Results</h2>\n<p>When elements of Stage 1 and Stage 2 audits are combined during a single on-site audit of the manufacturer, the report should include a clear description of the Stage 1 elements covered during the audit.</p>\n<h2>(I) Audit Plan</h2>\n<p>The report should include a copy of the audit plan. The report should document and explain the reason for any deviations from the audit plan.</p>\n<p>Note: For additional guidance on the content of the audit plan, see ISO/IEC 17021 9.1.2. and Annex F.</p>\n<h2>(J) Description of Major Changes Identified by the Manufacturer</h2>\n<p>The report should record when the manufacturer identifies an activity or process, that is to be audited, has been subject to a major change. This includes major changes to products or processes, changes to the organizational structure or ownership, changes to key personnel and facilities and to the QMS as a whole.</p>\n<h2>4.2.3 Audit Evidence</h2>\n<p>The audit report should include sufficient audit evidence to support the audit conclusions made in the report. The auditor should document audit evidence, evaluate the evidence against audit criteria and determine a finding, either of conformity or nonconformity. Information regarding the verification of the specific requirements from participating Regulatory Authorities should be included in the audit report.</p>\n<p>The Auditing Organization should note that the participating MDSAP Regulatory Authorities will conclude that the Auditing Organization did not audit an aspect or process of the manufacturer's QMS if omitted in the report. If a process of the manufacturer's QMS that is required to be audited by the audit type (e.g. initial, surveillance, re-audit) is not audited, the report should contain the rationale for not auditing the process.</p>\n<p>The report should record both findings of conformity and nonconformity. Report authors should refrain from providing specific advice, instructions or solutions towards the development and implementation of a QMS, or from suggesting opportunities for improvement (see IMDRF/MDSAP WG/N3 - 9.1.3).</p>\n<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>\n<h2>4.2.4 Audit Summaries</h2>\n<p>Written summaries of the audit of each of the processes or activities below should be included in the report. When multiple facilities are included in a single report, there must be clear separation and delineation of the summaries per audited site. The audit summaries should be brief but nonetheless include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>-description of the process or activity audited;</li>\n<li>-description of the areas (physical and organizational) of the site visited;</li>\n<li>-names and titles of persons interviewed;</li>\n<li>-key documents reviewed (procedures, work instructions, records etc.);</li>\n<li>-key documents used as reference by the manufacturer (guidance documents, standards etc.);</li>\n<li>-type and number of documents (documents or records) reviewed, including a qualitative statement of the sample size where appropriate;</li>\n<li>-identification of the products or components relevant to the process or activity audited; and,</li>\n<li>-assessment of changes and whether regulatory requirements have been satisfied, or continue to be satisfied, and whether required regulatory submissions were made when necessary; and,</li>\n<li>-concluding statements regarding whether the activity or process under audit is in conformity with the audit criteria.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note: the inclusion of clause numbers in the concluding statements can assist with demonstrating appropriate coverage.</p>\n<p>When an auditor verifies the implementation of corrections and/or corrective actions stemming from past nonconformities, the results of the verification should be included in the audit report, either as part of the Audit Summaries section or under a separate heading.</p>\n<p>Where the evidence supports a finding of nonconformity, the summary should include a crossreference to the nonconformity in the form of [NC #].</p>\n<p>The suggested content for the audit report of the processes must include as a minimum.</p>\n<h2>(A) Management:</h2>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: 'i. ';\">the extent of outsourcing of processes that may affect the conformity of product with specified requirements and verification of the proper documentation of controls in the quality management system;</li>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: 'ii.

voluntary group of medical device regulators from around the world.  The document has been subject to consultation throughout its development.\n\nThere are no restrictions on the reproduction, distribution or use of this document; however, incorporation of this document, in part or in whole, into any other document, or its translation into languages other than English, does not convey or represent an endorsement of any kind by the International Medical Device Regulators Forum.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis is one document in a collection of documents produced by the International Medical Device Regulators Forum (IMDRF) intended to implement the concept of a Medical Device Single Audit Program (MDSAP).  Two documents, IMDRF/MDSAP WG/N3 - 'Requirements for Medical Device Auditing Organizations for Regulatory Authority Recognition' and IMDRF/MDSAP WG/N4 - 'Competence and Training Requirements for Auditing Organizations,' are complementary documents.  These two documents N3 and N4 are focused on requirements for an Auditing Organization and individuals performing regulatory audits and other related functions under the respective medical device legislation, regulations, and procedures required in its regulatory jurisdiction.\n\nThree additional documents, IMDRF/MDSAP WG/N5 - 'Regulatory Authority Assessment Method for the Recognition and Monitoring of Medical Device Auditing Organizations,' IMDRF/MDSAP WG/N8  - 'Guidance for Regulatory Authority Assessors on the Method of Assessment for MDSAP Auditing Organizations' and IMDRF/MDSAP WG/N6 - 'Regulatory Authority Assessor Competence and Training Requirements,' are complementary documents. These three documents N5, N6, and N8 are focused on how Regulatory Authorities and their assessors will evaluate, or 'assess', a medical device Auditing Organizations' compliance to the requirements in the IMDRF MDSAP N3 and N4 documents.\n\nIn addition, IMDRF/MDSAP WG/N11 - 'MDSAP Assessment and Decision for the Recognition of an Auditing Organization' - defines a method to 'grade' nonconformities resulting from a Regulatory Authority assessment of an Auditing Organization and to document the decision process for recognizing an Auditing Organization or revoking recognition.\n\nThis document IMDRF/MDSAP WG/N24 describes the format and content of MDSAP medical device regulatory audit reports submitted to Regulatory Authorities. The audit report serves as a written record of the audit team's determination of the extent of fulfillment of specified requirements. It also serves to demonstrate the application of the rules of the recognized Auditing Organization's conformity assessment scheme. It enables the Auditing Organization to capture in a consistent manner the evidence of a manufacturer's conformity with the audit criteria for the MDSAP audit, and will facilitate the exchange of information between Regulatory Authorities.  The Regulatory Authorities that participate in the IMDRF agree that this document is to be used instead of the Global Harmonization Task Force (GHTF) SG4/N33 R16 document entitled, 'Guidelines for Regulatory Auditing of Quality Management Systems of Medical Device Manufacturers - Part 3: Regulatory Audit Reports.'\n\nThis collection of IMDRF MDSAP documents provide the fundamental building blocks by providing a common set of requirements to be utilized by the Regulatory Authorities for the recognition and monitoring of entities that perform regulatory audits and other related functions. It should be noted that in some jurisdictions the recognition process is called designation, notification, registration, or accreditation.\n\nIMDRF developed MDSAP to encourage and support global convergence of regulatory systems, where possible.  It seeks to strike a balance between the responsibilities of Regulatory\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nAuthorities to safeguard the health of their citizens as well as their obligations to avoid placing unnecessary burdens upon Auditing Organizations or the regulated industry.  IMDRF Regulatory Authorities may add additional requirements beyond this document when their legislation requires such additions.\n\nTo prevent the confusion between audits of manufacturers performed by auditors within an Auditing Organizations and audits of Auditing Organizations performed by medical device Regulatory Authority assessors, in this document, the latter are designated as 'assessments.'\n\n## 1.0 Scope\n\nThe scope of this guidance document is limited to the information that participating MDSAP Regulatory Authorities require in medical device regulatory audit reports, the format of reports and the information necessary for participating MDSAP Regulatory Authorities to effectively use the audit reports in accordance with their legislation.\n\nThe Auditing Organization shall utilize this reporting model for all audits other than Stage 1. For a Surveillance or Special Audit, it shall record in detail the applicable elements audited and identify those elements not within the scope of the audit.\n\n## 2.0 References\n\nIn addition to the definitions below, the definitions found in the following documents apply:\n\nIMDRF/MDSAP WG/N3 - Requirements for Medical Device Auditing Organizations for Regulatory Authority Recognition\n\nIMDRF/MDSAP WG/N4 - Competency and Training Requirements for Auditing Organizations\n\nGHTF/SG3/N19:2012 - Nonconformity Grading System for Regulatory Purposes and Information Exchange\n\nISO 9000:2005 - Quality management systems - Fundamentals and vocabulary\n\nISO/IEC 17000:2004 - Conformity assessment - Vocabulary and general principles\n\nISO/IEC 17021:2011 - Conformity assessment -Requirements for bodies providing audit and certification of management systems\n\n## 3.0 Definitions\n\n## Auditing Organization (AO)\n\nAn organization that audits a medical device manufacturer for conformity with quality management system requirements and other medical device regulatory requirements. Auditing\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\norganizations may be an independent organization or a Regulatory Authority which performs regulatory audits. (IMDRF/MDSAP WG/N3)\n\n## Manufacturer\n\nAny natural or legal person 1 with responsibility for design and/or manufacture of a medical device with the intention of making the medical device available for use, under his name; whether or not such a medical device is designed and/or manufactured by that person himself or on his behalf by another person(s).\n\nNotes:\n\n1. This 'natural or legal person' has ultimate legal responsibility for ensuring compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements for the medical device in the countries or jurisdictions where it is intended to be made available or sold, unless this responsibility is specifically imposed on another person by the Regulatory Authority (RA) within that jurisdiction.\n2. The manufacturer's responsibilities include meeting both pre-market requirements and post-market requirements, such as adverse event reporting and notification of corrective actions.\n3. 'Design and/or manufacture', as referred to in the above definition, may include specification development, production, fabrication, assembly, processing, packaging, repackaging, labeling, relabeling, sterilization, installation, or remanufacturing of a medical device; or putting a collection of devices, and possibly other products, together for a medical purpose.\n4. Any person who assembles or adapts a medical device that has already been supplied by another person for an individual patient, in accordance with the instructions for use, is not the manufacturer, provided the assembly or adaptation does not change the intended use of the medical device.\n5. Any person who changes the intended use of, or modifies, a medical device without acting on behalf of the original manufacturer and who makes it available for use under his own name, should be considered the manufacturer of the modified medical device.\n6. An authorized representative, distributor or importer who only adds its own address and contact details to the medical device or the packaging, without covering or changing the existing labeling, is not considered a manufacturer.\n7. To the extent that an accessory is subject to the regulatory requirements of a medical device, the person responsible for the design and/or manufacture of that accessory is considered to be a manufacturer.\n\n(GHTF/SG1/N055: 2009)\n\n1 The term 'person' that appears here includes legal entities such as a corporation, a partnership or an association.\n\n2 October 2015\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\n## 4.0 Guidance for Implementation\n\n## 4.1 Report Language\n\nFor the MDSAP, all audit reports shall be available in English.\n\nIt is preferable that report authors prepare reports using the grammatical form of 'active voice' using first person (with the identification of the first person when there are multiple authors) and the past tense. Active voice ensures that the focus of a sentence is on the correct subject, reducing ambiguity and improving clarity.  First person ensures the specific individual responsible for an audit activity or audit finding can be identified. The language should be unambiguous, concise, self-explanatory and clarifying that any finding is linked to a requirement.\n\n## 4.2 Report Content\n\n## 4.2.1 Information about the Manufacturer\n\nThe following items should be included in the report:\n\n## (A) Manufacturer's Name and Address\n\nThe report should include the name and full address of the manufacturer subject to the audit.\n\nNote: it is recommended that the manufacturer's name and address is consistent with what appears on a certification document, and if applicable any Regulatory Authority registration.\n\n## (B) Audited Facility's Name and Address\n\nThe report should include the name and full address of the audited facility subject to an audit plan.
